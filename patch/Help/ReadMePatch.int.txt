                Unreal Tournament 2004 Patch 7 Release notes.
========================================================================

This patch is completely compatible with the retail version - servers and clients of any flavor can connect with each other.
This patch will not overwrite your ut2004.ini and user.ini files, except to update settings as necessary.  This patch 
includes all changes made in Patches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,and 6.

This patch should be installed *after* installing the Epic ECE Bonus Pack, as it updates some of the game code included 
with the bonus pack.

  Logs dangling references which could cause a crash during gameplay or on GC.  Use only for testing, as it 
  is very slow, by adding bSlowRefChecking=true to the [Engine.Engine] section of UT2004.ini.  I'd recommend 
  running a dedicated server with bots with this option enabled, connect to it to start the match, and let the

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING UNREALED and Windows 98

If you plan on using UnrealED with Windows 98, you will need to download an install the MSVCP60.DLL library.  This
file can be found at the following url:

http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp60

Without that file, the editor will not run.

	  - improved vehicle turret replication at low net bandwidths
	  - improved old pawn replication at low net bandwidths
	  - Added bWasSaturated flag to PlayerController - set on server side when connection was saturated the previous tick

- Automatically export to .ucl file when package is compiled.
- Automatically export to .ucl file when map is saved.
- Custom webadmin skins no longer required to provide every .inc file that webadmin uses

- Can specify a Paths= for music (.ogg) and karma data (.ka) files, so they can be included in the mod's directory structure.
- Config variables properly save to UT2004\ModName\System\Whatever.ini instead of UT2004\System\Whatever.ini.

- Gracefully handle lack of tooltips in mod menus.
- fixed USoundExporterWAV to not try to export procedural sounds and sound groups
- Added AddToPackageMap() native function to Actor. This function adds PackageName to the packagemap (as if it was in GameEngine's ServerPackages list), 
  or, if omitted, adds the package of the actor it was called on. This function is only valid during initialization (between GameInfo::InitGame() and 
  GameInfo::SetInitialState()) If called outside of that window, or anytime on a client, the function returns without doing anything.
