Title="The Fallen City"
Description="Following the human/Skaarj war, many of Earth's cities lay in ruins.  When the New Earth Government attempted to assert its authority over these areas, they were confronted by many rebel groups, often covertly financed by the great corporations, which had established bases in the destroyed cities. This scenario recreates the destruction of a rebel command center by NEG forces. In keeping with the historical battle, the attacker's insertion point is a distance away from the command center, because of the heavy anti-aircraft protection around the bunker."

","The attackers must first make their way through the streets on foot and clear out any resistance they find. They must destroy the barricade in order to proceed to the next objective.","Next, they must take out the forward outpost. When the area is clear, a shipment of heavier cargo will be dropped in to help you proceed.","The defenders are nestled deep within this hardened bunker. You will have to bypass the defenses and infiltrate the bunker to reach their command center.","Reach the underground command center and place explosives to destroy the entire base. This should bring the resistance to its knees.")
