IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PROMPTLY DISCONTINUE THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND CEASE ALL USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
1.	Thanks.  Congratulations and thank you for licensing our software.  We're sorry to cramp your style, but out lawyers tell us that if we want to keep control and ownership of the cool stuff we're developing, we have to make sure you understand and agree that you are just buying a right to use it and that that right is limited in certain ways.  So what follows is what you need to know and agree to.  
2.	License.  The software accompanying this license and the related documentation (the “Software”) are licensed for your use and gaming enjoyment, subject to terms and limitations in this license agreement.  The license fee you paid gives you the right to use the Software.  If the Software is configured for loading onto a hard drive, you may only load the Software onto the hard drive of a single computer and only run the Software off that hard drive, however you may participate in a multiplayer configuration (such as in an Internet gaming room) with other players who also have valid licenses; in other words, your friends must license their own copies of the Software.  There is an editor incorporated into the Software which, if you use it, is subject to Section 8 below.  
3.	Commercial Exploitation. You may not use this game, or any Mods created for this game or using the tools provided with this game, for any commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Epic Games Inc. including, but not limited to, the following rules: 1. If you are the proprietor of an Internet café or gaming room, you may operate the Software in a “pay for play” environment provided that all computers used have validly licensed Software installed, such Software having been purchased at a retail store or other similar provider (we do not offer volume discounts or multi-install licenses).  2. You may not, without prior written consent from Epic, operate the Software in any gaming contest where (a) the cash value of all winnings and prizes paid throughout the entire competition is equal to or greater than US$5,000.00 OR (b) the name of the event, or any individual contest therein, incorporates or approximates the name of a company, product or commercial service OR (c) any company has provided, whether donated or as sponsorship, prizes, products or services worth with a fair market value of over US$5,000.00. 
4.	Use Restrictions.  We want you to enjoy our products for years to come, and we want to be able to continue to make awesome games, so you need to be aware that there are some things you cannot do with the Software.  The Software contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary material.  You may not decompile, modify, reverse engineer, publicly display, prepare derivative works based on the Software (except as permitted in Section 8, below), disassemble or otherwise reproduce the Software.  Except as set forth herein, you may not rent, sell, lease, barter, sublicense or distribute the Software.  You may not delete the copyright notices or any other proprietary legends on the original copy of the Software.

You may not ship or export the Software to any country other than where you bought it, in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) and you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize the Software in violation of any applicable law.  The Software may not be downloaded or otherwise exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to anyone or into any country who/which are prohibited by applicable law, from receiving it.
5.	CHEATING.  Nobody likes a cheater.  It's a disgraceful way to earn a win and really is an insult to those players who earn their wins in on-line games the old-fashioned way—WITH TALENT.  We're pretty hard on cheating in on-line games using the Software because it sullies the overall gaming experience and is JUST PLAIN LAME.  With that in mind if you are caught cheating in an on-line game using the Software we will immediately and permanently ban your CD Key.  At that point this License Agreement is automatically terminated and you must immediately delete this software from your PC.  Failure to comply with this last bit (deleting the software) may bring on the wrath of the lawyers.  Trust us…you don't want that.
6.	Termination.  This license is effective until one of us terminate it.  You may terminate this license at any time by destroying the Software and related documentation.  In the unlikely event that you are naughty and fail to comply with any provision of this license, this license will terminate immediately without notice from us.  Upon termination, you must destroy the Software and related documentation.  Please don't wait for us to come after you; it would not be pleasant for either of us.  If we do have to come after you, we're going to expect you to pay us for our troubles, including the cost of our lawyers.
