1.	Thanks.  Congratulations and thank you for licensing our
software.  We're sorry to cramp your style, but out lawyers tell us
that if we want to keep control and ownership of the cool stuff we're
developing, we have to make sure you understand and agree that you are
just buying a right to use it and that that right is limited in certain
ways.  So here's what follows is what you need to know and agree to.  
2.	License.  The software accompanying this license and the
related documentation (the 'Software') are licensed for your use and
gaming enjoyment, subject to terms and limitations in this license
agreement.  The license fee you paid gives you the right to use the
Software.  If the Software is configured for loading onto a hard drive,
you may only load the Software onto the hard drive of a single computer
and only run the Software off that hard drive, however you may
participate in a multiplayer configuration (such as in an Internet
gaming room) with other players who also have valid licenses; in other
words, your friends must license their own copies of the Software. 
There is an editor incorporated into the Software which, if you use it,
is subject to Section 8 below.

offer volume discounts or multi-install licenses).  2. You may not,
without prior written consent from Epic, operate the Software in any
gaming contest where (a) the cash value of all winnings and prizes paid
throughout the entire competition is equal to or greater than
US$5,000.00 OR (b) the name of the event, or any individual contest

must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material, as
required by 17 U.S.C. section 101 et seq. and other applicable law. 
Please do not make unauthorized copies.  The program you've licensed
was produced through the efforts of many people who earn their
livelihood from its lawful use.  These people like to eat, so don't
make copies for others who have not paid for the right to use it.  To
report copyright violations to the Software Publishers Association,
call 1 800 388 PIR8 or write:  Software Publishers Association, 1101

and grumblings within the gaming community about heavy handed, legally
onerous license agreements.  You have our word that this one is as fair
and even handed as it gets and, as you have read this far, you know it
to be true.  Now, be gone from this screen and enjoy the Software,
including the UnrealEd.
